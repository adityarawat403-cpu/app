<div class="container"><h1>ReplyShastra Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="small">Last updated: 2026</p><h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
ReplyShastra is an AI-powered reply suggestion tool. We respect user privacy and design the app to minimize collection of personal information.
</p><h2>2. Message Processing</h2>
<p>
When you type a message, the text is processed only to generate a suggested reply. Conversations are not publicly visible and are not shared with other users.
</p><h2>3. Account Information</h2>
<p>
If you create an account, we may store basic identifiers such as email address for login, security, and subscription management purposes.
</p><h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
<p>
We may analyze anonymized and non-identifiable usage data to improve reply quality, performance, and system reliability. Personal conversations are not manually reviewed or exposed publicly.
</p><h2>5. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
ReplyShastra does not publish or sell user conversations. Messages may be temporarily processed for generating replies but are not displayed to other users.
</p><h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
We implement reasonable technical measures to protect user data against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
</p><h2>7. User Control</h2>
<p>
You may stop using the service at any time. Avoid entering highly sensitive personal or financial information into the application.
</p><h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
Certain features (login, analytics, or hosting) may rely on secure third-party infrastructure providers necessary to operate the service.
</p><h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy as features evolve. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
